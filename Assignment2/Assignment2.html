Billionaires Index and Forbes' real-time billionaires list.
</p>
<p>
<span style="color:blue;"><b>Musk</b></span> was born in Pretoria, South Africa, where he grew up. He briefly attended the University of Pretoria before
moving to Canada at age 17, acquiring citizenship through his Canadian-born mother. Two years later, he
matriculated at Queen's University and transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, where he received bachelor's
degrees in Economics and Physics. He moved to California in <u>1995</u> to attend Stanford University but decided
instead to pursue a business career, co-founding the web software company Zip2 with his brother Kimbal. The
startup was acquired by Compaq for <span style="color:green;"><b>$</b></span>307 million in 1999. The same year, <span style="color:blue;"><b>Musk</b></span> co-founded online bank X.com,
which merged with Confinity in <u>2000</u> to form PayPal. eBay bought PayPal in <u>2002</u>, for <span style="color:green;"><b>$</b></span>1.5 billion.</p>

<h2> Early life </h2>
<h3> Childhood and family </h3>
<p>Elon Reeve <span style="color:blue;"><b>Musk</b></span> was born on <u>June 28, 1971</u>, in Pretoria, one of the capital cities of apartheid South Africa.[8][9]
His mother is Maye <span style="color:blue;"><b>Musk</b></span> (nÃ©e Haldeman), a model and dietitian born in Saskatchewan, Canada, but raised in
South Africa.[10][11][12] His father is Errol <span style="color:blue;"><b>Musk</b></span>, a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, sailor,
consultant, and property developer who was a half-owner of a Zambian emerald mine near Lake Tanganyika.[13]
[14] <span style="color:blue;"><b>Musk</b></span> has a younger brother, Kimbal (born 1972), and a younger sister, Tosca (born 1974).[12][15] His
maternal grandfather, Joshua Haldeman, was an adventurous American-born Canadian who took his family on
record-breaking journeys in a single-engine Bellanca airplane to Africa and Australia.[16][17][18] <span style="color:blue;"><b>Musk</b></span> has
British and Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry.[19][20] He was baptized into the Anglican Church. </p>

<p><span style="color:blue;"><b>Musk</b></span>'s family was wealthy during his youth. His father was elected to the Pretoria City Council as a
representative of the anti-apartheid Progressive Party, with the <span style="color:blue;"><b>Musk</b></span> children reportedly sharing their father's
dislike of apartheid.[8] After his parents divorced in <u>1980</u>, <span style="color:blue;"><b>Musk</b></span> mostly lived with his father,[19] a choice he
made two years after the divorce and subsequently regretted.[23] <span style="color:blue;"><b>Musk</b></span> has become estranged from his father.
[23] He has a paternal half-sister and a half-brother.</p>

<h3> Education </h3>
<p>Aware it would be easier to enter the United States from Canada,[31] <span style="color:blue;"><b>Musk</b></span> applied for a Canadian passport
through his Canadian-born mother.[32][33] While awaiting the documentation, he attended the University of
Pretoria for five months; this allowed him to avoid mandatory service in the South African military.[34] <span style="color:blue;"><b>Musk</b></span>
arrived in Canada in June 1989 and lived with a second cousin in Saskatchewan for a year,[35] working odd jobs
at a farm and lumber-mill.[36] In <u>1990</u>1, he entered Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario.[37][38] Two years
later, he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, where he completed studies for a Bachelor of Arts degree in
physics and a Bachelor of Science degree in economics from the Wharton School in <u>1995</u>.
</p>
<p>In 1994, <span style="color:blue;"><b>Musk</b></span> held two internships in Silicon Valley during the summer: at energy storage startup Pinnacle
Research Institute, which investigated electrolytic ultracapacitors for energy storage, and at the Palo Alto-based
startup Rocket Science Games.[41] In <u>1995</u>, he was accepted to a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) program in
materials science at Stanford University in California.[42] <span style="color:blue;"><b>Musk</b></span> tried to get a job at Netscape but never received
a response to his inquiries.[32] He dropped out of Stanford after two days, deciding instead to join the Internet
boom and launch a startup.
</p>

<h2> Business career </h2>
<h3> Zip2 </h3>
<p>In <u>1995</u>, <span style="color:blue;"><b>Musk</b></span>, his brother Kimbal, and Greg Kouri founded web software company Zip2 with funds borrowed
from <span style="color:blue;"><b>Musk</b></span>'s father.[44][23] They housed the venture at a small rented office in Palo Alto.[45] The company
developed and marketed an Internet city guide for the newspaper publishing industry, with maps, directions, and
yellow pages.[46] <span style="color:blue;"><b>Musk</b></span> says that before the company became successful, he could not afford an apartment and
instead rented an office; he slept on the couch, showered at the YMCA, and shared one computer with his brother.
</p>

<p>According to <span style="color:blue;"><b>Musk</b></span>, "The website was up during the day and I was coding it at night, seven days a week, all the
time."[45] The <span style="color:blue;"><b>Musk</b></span> brothers obtained contracts with The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune,[48] and
persuaded the board of directors to abandon plans for a merger with CitySearch.[49] <span style="color:blue;"><b>Musk</b></span>'s attempts to become
ceo were thwarted by the board.[50] Compaq acquired Zip2 for <span style="color:green;"><b>$</b></span>307 million in cash in February <u>1999</u>,[51][52]
and <span style="color:blue;"><b>Musk</b></span> received <span style="color:green;"><b>$</b></span>22 million for his 7-percent share.</p>

<h3> X.com and PayPal </h3>

<p>In <u>1999</u>, <span style="color:blue;"><b>Musk</b></span> co-founded X.com, an online financial services and e-mail payment company.[54] The startup was
one of the first federally insured online banks, and, in its initial months of operation, over 200,000 customers
joined the service.[55] The company's investors regarded <span style="color:blue;"><b>Musk</b></span> as inexperienced and replaced him with Intuit
ceo Bill Harris by the end of the year.[56] The following year, X.com merged with online bank Confinity to avoid
competition.[45][56][57] Founded by Max Levchin and Peter Thiel,[58] Confinity had its own money-transfer
service, PayPal, which was more popular than X.com's service.
</p>

<p>Within the merged company, <span style="color:blue;"><b>Musk</b></span> returned as ceo. <span style="color:blue;"><b>Musk</b></span>'s preference for Microsoft software over Unix created
a rift in the company and caused Thiel to resign.[60] Due to resulting technological issues and lack of a cohesive
business model, the board ousted <span style="color:blue;"><b>Musk</b></span> and replaced him with Thiel in September <u>2000</u>.[61][b] Under Thiel, the
company focused on the PayPal service and was renamed PayPal in 2001.[63][64] In <u>2002</u>, PayPal was acquired
by eBay for <span style="color:green;"><b>$</b></span>1.5 billion in stock, of which <span style="color:blue;"><b>Musk</b></span>â€”the largest shareholder with 11.72% of sharesâ€”received <span style="color:green;"><b>$</b></span>175.8
million.[65][66] In <u>2017</u>, <span style="color:blue;"><b>Musk</b></span> purchased the domain X.com from PayPal for an undisclosed amount, explaining it
has sentimental value.</p>

<h3>SpaceX</h3>
<p>In early 2001, <span style="color:blue;"><b>Musk</b></span> became involved with the nonprofit Mars Society and discussed funding plans to place a
growth-chamber for plants on Mars.[69] In October the same year, he traveled to Moscow with Jim Cantrell and
Adeo Ressi to buy refurbished intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that could send the greenhouse payloads
into space. He met with companies NPO Lavochkin and Kosmotras; however, <span style="color:blue;"><b>Musk</b></span> was seen as a novice[70] and
the group returned to the United States empty-handed. In February <u>2002</u>, the group returned to Russia with Mike
Griffin (president of In-Q-Tel) to look for three ICBMs. They had another meeting with Kosmotras and were offered
one rocket for <span style="color:green;"><b>$</b></span>8 million, which <span style="color:blue;"><b>Musk</b></span> rejected. He instead decided to start a company that could build affordable
rockets.[70] With <span style="color:green;"><b>$</b></span>100 million of his early fortune,[71] <span style="color:blue;"><b>Musk</b></span> founded <span style="color:red;"><i>SpaceX</i></span> in <u>May 2002</u> and became the
company's ceo and Chief Engineer.
</p>

<p><span style="color:red;"><i>SpaceX</i></span> attempted its first launch of the Falcon 1 rocket in <u>2006</u>.[74] Though the rocket failed to reach Earth
orbit, it was awarded a Commercial Orbital Transportation Services program contract from NASA Administrator
(and former <span style="color:red;"><i>SpaceX</i></span> consultant[75]) Mike Griffin later that year.[76][77] After two more failed attempts that
nearly caused <span style="color:blue;"><b>Musk</b></span> and his companies to bankrupt,[74] <span style="color:red;"><i>SpaceX</i></span> succeeded in launching the Falcon 1 into orbit in
<u>2008</u>.[78] Later that year, <span style="color:red;"><i>SpaceX</i></span> received a <span style="color:green;"><b>$</b></span>1.6 billion Commercial Resupply Services program contract from
NASA for 12 flights of its Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft to the International Space Station, replacing the
Space Shuttle after its <u>2011</u> retirement.[79] In <u>2012</u>, the Dragon vehicle berthed with the ISS, a first for a private
enterprise.[80] <span style="color:blue;"><b>Musk</b></span> credited the NASA award, one of the last actions by Mike Griffin as NASA Administrator, for
saving the company.
